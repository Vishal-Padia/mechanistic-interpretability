# mechanistic-interpretability
Bunch of experiments I'll be doing regarding mech interp

# Experiments

## 1. Neuron Feature Correspondance Analysis

This experiment is done to understand if there's an relationship between the neurons and it's activation strength wrt features of the input data.

Check out the implementation and findings in the [Neuron Feature Correspondance Analysis](Neuron-Feature-Correspondance-Analysis) directory.
