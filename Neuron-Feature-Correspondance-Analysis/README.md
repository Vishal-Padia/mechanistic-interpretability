# Reason for this experiment:

I was reading this [blog](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary), in which Neel Nanda (the author of the blog) mentions a concept "Features as Neurons". 
> Each feature corresponds to specific neuron and that the neuronâ€™s activation is the strength of that feature on that input

This got me thinking, if this is true, then there should be a way to quantify the strength of a feature on a neuron. So I decided to try to do an experiement to see if this is true and also to get an intuition of how strong a feature is on a neuron.

This reminds me something from an episode of The Big Bang Theory, where Amy conducts an experiment synthesizing a neural network using skin cells from both her and Sheldon. During this process, she discusses the scientific approach of replicating brain activity to better understand cognition and discovery.

> I'm not sure whether this is something related to the experiment I'm try to do, but it's interesting to note this sparked in my mind immediately when I read about the concept of "Features as Neurons".
